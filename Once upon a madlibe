Once upon a (child). There was a (blurry) house, filled with (frogs).
 All of the children near the house loved to listen to the (songs) every morning before (food).
 They all would (run) and (laugh) as they watched them. The (leaves) had fantastic orange (suits) and blue tinted (hair)
 One (quickly) all the children heard that the (frogs) had stopped (shrieking).
 They all (ducked) for (house).
 Their favorite (stone) came to their rescue.
 He was able to (save) with all of his (funky) (deer). Saving the day. Saving the (tree) made them grow (four) times its size.

From then on every (gong) the children would watch for an even bigger and louder (jump).The town shouted " Long live the (cat)!" The town was restored to normal.
